JENKINS
========

1. If we have 5 stages in a Jenkins pipeline and 5th stage having syntax error then what will happen if we run the pipeline.
- Pipeline fails at syntax check before execution; entire run fails.
2. What are some main differences between scripted and declarative pipeline.
Feature	    Declarative Pipeline	      Scripted Pipeline
--------    --------------------        -----------------
Syntax	    Structured (DSL style)	    Freeform Groovy scripting
Readability	Easier to read and maintain	More complex but flexible
Error       Handling	                  Limited, controlled via post	Fully customizable
Flexibility	Moderate	                  High (can use functions, loops)
Use Case	  Simple/standard pipelines	  Complex/custom pipelines
