1. Kubernetes Architecture in My Project (Real-Time Use Case)

In our project, we run a highly available Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS to host microservices.

Cluster Setup:
We use EKS managed control plane (multi-AZ) with 3 availability zones for fault tolerance. Worker nodes run on EC2 Auto Scaling groups with spot + on-demand mix for cost efficiency.

Networking:
Calico CNI for pod networking and enforcing network policies for inter-service communication. External traffic comes via AWS ALB Ingress Controller, which handles routing to services.

Workload Management:
Microservices are packaged into Docker images, pushed to ECR, and deployed as Deployments and StatefulSets. Stateful services (Kafka, ZooKeeper, Redis) run on StatefulSets with EBS volumes. HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) scales pods based on CPU/memory and custom Prometheus metrics.

Observability:
Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, ELK stack for logs. Alerts integrated with PagerDuty/Slack for real-time notifications.

Security & Governance:
IAM roles mapped to Kubernetes service accounts (IRSA) for secure AWS access. RBAC implemented at namespace/team level. Docker images scanned with Trivy before deployment.

Use Case Example:
Order Processing Platform services (payment, shipment, notifications) are deployed in Kubernetes. During traffic spikes (e.g., sales events), HPA auto-scales pods across nodes. If a node fails, workloads are automatically rescheduled by the control plane.



1. Kubernetes Architecture in My Project (Real-Time Use Case)

We run a highly available AWS EKS cluster hosting multiple microservices:

Cluster Setup: Multi-AZ control plane, worker nodes in EC2 Auto Scaling groups (mix of spot + on-demand).
Networking: Calico CNI, enforced network policies, ALB Ingress for external traffic.
Workloads: Stateless apps on Deployments, Stateful apps (Kafka, Redis) on StatefulSets with persistent EBS volumes. HPA scales based on CPU/memory and custom Prometheus metrics.
Observability: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, ELK for logs, alerts routed to Slack/PagerDuty.
Security: RBAC, IAM roles mapped to service accounts (IRSA), images scanned with Trivy.
Example Use Case: Order processing platform auto-scales during peak events; failed nodes are auto-rescheduled without downtime.


2. CI/CD Flow – GitLab CI/CD (Project Context)

Workflow: Developers push code → Merge Request triggers pipeline in GitLab.

Stages:
  Build: Docker image built, pushed to ECR.
  Test: Unit tests, integration tests, linting, SonarQube scans.
  Deploy: Helm charts deploy to Kubernetes namespaces (Dev → QA → Prod).
  Notifications: Slack/email alerts for pipeline success/failure.
Approvals: Production deployments require approvals from DevOps and QA.
Real Project Use Case: For payment service updates, pipelines auto-deploy minor patches in <10 mins with zero manual intervention.


3. CI/CD Flow – Jenkins (Project Context)

Pipeline Type: Declarative Jenkinsfile with multiple stages.

Stages:
  Checkout: GitHub repo cloned.
  Build: Maven/Gradle or Docker build.
  Test: Unit tests + SonarQube scan.
  Package & Push: Docker images pushed to ECR.
  Deploy: Helm charts to Kubernetes clusters.
  Notifications: Slack + email alerts.
Example Use Case: Automated rollback configured in case the deployed version fails health checks.


4. AWS Services Used in the Project

Compute: EC2 (on-demand + reserved), Lambda for serverless workloads, ECS/EKS.
Storage: S3 for objects, EBS/EFS for volumes.
Networking: VPCs with private/public subnets, ALB/NLB, Route53 DNS.
Databases: RDS (Postgres/MySQL), DynamoDB, ElastiCache (Redis).
Monitoring & Security: CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config, IAM, GuardDuty.
Cost Optimization: Reserved Instances, AutoScaling, Spot instances, S3 lifecycle rules.

Use Case: Auto-scaling EC2 nodes for order-processing microservices during peak hours, saving 20% on monthly costs.

5. Kafka Architecture in the Project

Cluster Setup: Multi-AZ Kafka brokers with Zookeeper (or KRaft in Kafka 3.x).
Topics & Partitions: Partitioned for high throughput, replication factor = 3 for durability.
Producers/Consumers: Microservices push events (orders/payments); consumers process asynchronously.
Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards, Lag monitoring with Burrow.

Use Case: Real-time order event streaming; ensures consumer lag stays minimal during Black Friday spikes.

6. Setting Up Kubernetes Cluster from Scratch

Infrastructure: EC2 nodes provisioned for master and workers.
Installation: Docker/containerd, kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl installed.
Cluster Bootstrapping: kubeadm init → kubeadm join for workers.
Networking: Calico CNI, pod CIDR configured.
Add-ons: CoreDNS, Metrics Server, Ingress, Dashboard.
Security: RBAC, namespaces, network policies.
Observability: Prometheus + Grafana, EFK stack.

Use Case: Production cluster supporting multiple namespaces (Dev, QA, Prod) with HPA autoscaling.

7. Reducing Monthly AWS Costs by 20%

Problem: High EC2 and underutilized RDS instances increasing costs.
Actions: Rightsized EC2, moved workloads to AutoScaling groups, purchased Reserved Instances.
Results: ~20% cost reduction monthly.

Use Case: Auto-termination of idle instances during off-peak hours, reducing unnecessary spend without affecting service.

8. Reducing Deployment Time by 40%

Problem: Manual deployments took 30–40 minutes with frequent errors.
Actions: Automated CI/CD pipelines (GitLab/Jenkins) with Helm charts.
Results: Deployment time reduced to <10 mins, manual errors cut by 90%.

Use Case: Microservices for order processing deployed automatically during business hours with zero downtime.

9. Recent RCA

Incident: API requests in production were timing out.
Root Cause: High pod memory usage due to memory leak in a microservice.
Fix: Added resource limits, implemented liveness probes, redeployed pods.
Outcome: Performance normalized, no recurrence.

Use Case: Prevented similar outages by monitoring memory metrics and alerts.

10. Complex AWS Issue Resolved

Incident: EC2 instances in ASG terminated unexpectedly.
Root Cause: ALB health check misconfigured; unhealthy instances marked for termination.
Fix: Adjusted health check thresholds, verified AMI startup scripts.

Use Case: Maintained high availability for payment microservices without downtime.

11. Reducing Incident Detection Time by 50% (ELK + Prometheus)

Problem: Manual log checks caused delays in detecting production issues (~20 mins).
Action: Centralized logs in ELK; Prometheus + Grafana for metrics + PagerDuty alerts.
Result: Detection time reduced to <10 mins.

Use Case: Real-time alerting for microservices, improved SLA compliance.
