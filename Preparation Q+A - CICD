CICD
====

1. CICD Workflow
CI – Continuous Integration
- Code Commit: Developer pushes code to Git repo (e.g., GitLab, GitHub).
- Pipeline Trigger: CI pipeline is triggered (automatically or manually).
- Build: Code is compiled/built (e.g., Java via Maven/Gradle).
- Unit Testing: Runs automated tests to validate functionality.
- Code Analysis: Tools like SonarQube check for code quality/security.

CD – Continuous Delivery/Deployment
- Artifact Creation: Output of build is packaged (e.g., .jar, .war, Docker image).
- Artifact Storage: Stored in a repository (e.g., Nexus, GitLab Registry, ECR).
- Deployment to Environment: (Dev/Test/Stage/Prod) using Helm, kubectl, etc.
- Smoke Testing: Optional post-deploy test for app readiness.
- Notification: Teams are notified via Slack/email/ServiceNow.

2. Difference between code quality and code coverage.
➡️ Code quality checks how good the code is.
➡️ Code coverage checks how much of the code is tested.

Code quality - Measures the maintainability, reliability, and security of code. Includes detecting bugs, code smells, security vulnerabilities.
Code coverage - Measures the percentage of code covered by tests (unit tests, integration tests). High coverage = more tested code.

3. Where do you write the code/yaml file for pipeline
4. How to schedule pipeline, lets say i have validated the pipeline with some update and i want to schedule it to stage/main branch, how to do? (This also someone explain)
5. CICD - What kind of CI/CD pipelines are you familiar with?
