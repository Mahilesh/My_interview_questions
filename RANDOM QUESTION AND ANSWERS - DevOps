#KUBERNETES
1. How do you configure Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring?

We configure Prometheus and Grafana on EKS using Helm charts. Prometheus is deployed to scrape metrics from Kubernetes components, cAdvisor, and Node Exporter (running as a DaemonSet on each node). Grafana is then set up as a separate Helm release, connected to Prometheus as a data source, and we import dashboards for visualizing cluster and application metrics.
