===========
1.	Are you running Elasticsearch on-premises or using Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)?
2.	Which version of open-source Elasticsearch are you currently using?
3.	How do you deploy the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) in Kubernetes — for example, how do you handle components like Filebeat (as a DaemonSet)?
4.	Have you encountered any recent issues or performance challenges with Elasticsearch in your project? How did you resolve them?
5.	Is your Elasticsearch cluster exposed externally (public access) or restricted for internal access only?
6.	What types of services are commonly used in your Kubernetes setup (e.g., ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, etc.)?
7.	Can you explain how networking works in Kubernetes — for example, how Pods, Services, and Ingress communicate?
8.	How do different Kubernetes components communicate with each other (e.g., kube-apiserver, kubelet, controller manager)?
9.	What’s the difference between a Pod and a Container in Kubernetes?
10.	What’s the difference between a StatefulSet and a Deployment (Stateless application)?
11.	How do you integrate Kubernetes with Vault or a Secret Manager? Where do you specify secret references in your manifests?
12.	How do you implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in your Kubernetes cluster?
13.	What are the key sections typically defined inside a deployment.yaml file?
14.	After deploying an application in Kubernetes, how do you verify that it’s running correctly and healthy?
15.	Do you use Kustomize for environment-specific configurations in your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitLab)?3
