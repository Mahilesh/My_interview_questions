What to do if an application is down
Scenario based includes 3 sub-questions 
a) If any service is down for more than 2 weeks and customer is asking for update, what will you tell to customer?
b) How to troubleshoot the issue and what will be checked during the process
c) what steps to take so that the issue will not happen in future 
In Airflow, if a job fails, how do you debug it?
If you're facing performance issues on a server, how do you troubleshoot?
Introduction
Explain current project 
1.Introduce yourself 
14.have you worked on production deployment activity ?
15.how frequently do we deploy to production in your current project

Kubernetes
===========

1. Your pod keeps getting stuck in CrashLoopBackOff, but logs show no errors. How would you approach debugging and resolution?
2. You have a StatefulSet deployed with persistent volumes, and one of the pods is not recreating properly after deletion. What could be the reasons, and how do you fix it without data loss?
3. Your cluster autoscaler is not scaling up even though pods are in Pending state. What would you investigate?
4. A network policy is blocking traffic between services in different namespaces. How would you design and debug the policy to allow only specific communication paths?
5. One of your microservices has to connect to an external database via a VPN inside the cluster. How would you architect this in Kubernetes with HA and security in mind?
6. You're running a multi-tenant platform on a single EKS cluster. How do you isolate workloads and ensure security, quotas, and observability for each tenant?
7. You notice the kubelet is constantly restarting on a particular node. What steps would you take to isolate the issue and ensure node stability?
8. A critical pod in production gets evicted due to node pressure. How would you prevent this from happening again, and how do QoS classes play a role?
9. You need to deploy a service that requires TCP and UDP on the same port. How would you configure this in Kubernetes using Services and Ingress?
10. An application upgrade caused downtime even though you had rolling updates configured. What advanced strategies would you apply to ensure zero-downtime deployments next time?
11. Your service mesh sidecar (e.g., Istio Envoy) is consuming more resources than the app itself. How do you analyze and optimize this setup?
12. You need to create a Kubernetes operator to automate complex application lifecycle events. How do you design the CRD and controller loop logic?
13. Multiple nodes are showing high disk IO usage due to container logs. What Kubernetes features or practices can you apply to avoid this scenario?
14. Your Kubernetes cluster's etcd performance is degrading. What are the root causes and how do you ensure etcd high availability and tuning?
15. You want to enforce that all images used in the cluster must come from a trusted internal registry. How do you implement this at the policy level?
16. You're managing multi-region deployments using a single Kubernetes control plane. What architectural considerations must you address to avoid cross-region latency and single points of failure?
17. During peak traffic, your ingress controller fails to route requests efficiently. How would you diagnose and scale ingress resources effectively under heavy load?
18. Asked about k8s ( deployment, services, and configs) 
19. Pod disruption budget
20. About K8's Architecture and tell me the workflow?
21. Tell about RBAC 
22. in ur projects how many containers u ran? can u give me the use case where can run 4-5 containers in a pod?
23. How many containers can run in a pod?
24.what will be your approach if pod.yaml failed
25.explain kubernets architecture
