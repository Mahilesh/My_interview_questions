GRAFANA
========

1. How do you configure a Grafana dashboard?

Step1:- Add a Data Source
  Go to Settings > Data Sources, choose the appropriate backend (like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, MySQL or InfluxDB), enter the connection details, and test the connection.
Step2:- Create a Dashboard
  Click on the "+" icon > Dashboard, and then "Add new panel" to begin creating visualizations.
Step3:- Configure Panels
  Inside each panel,
    - Select the data source
    - Write a query to fetch the required metrics
    - Choose a visualization type like Graph, Gauge, Table, or Stat
    - Set panel titles, units (e.g., %, ms), and thresholds if needed
Step4:- Use Variables (Optional)
  For dynamic dashboards, I create template variables (like $instance) so users can filter panels based on hosts, environments, etc.
Step5:- Save and Share
  Once done, I save the dashboard and optionally share it via a link or export it as JSON.
Step6:- Alerts (If Needed)
  If supported by the data source, I configure alerts by defining alert rules, thresholds, and notification channels (like email or Slack).
