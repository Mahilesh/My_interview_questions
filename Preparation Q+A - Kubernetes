Kubernetes
==========

1. Kubernetes architecture
- Kubernetes follows a master-worker architecture (also known as control plane and nodes). It consists of the following key components:
- Controller plane (Master nodes), Data plane (Worker nodes)
  - In controller plane, consistes of components like API-server, Schedular, etcd, Controller Manager, Cloud Controller Manager
      - API-server - Acts as the entry point for all Kubernetes commands (kubectl, REST API). It handles authentication, authorization, and communicates with all components.
      - Schedular - Assigns newly created pods to available worker nodes based on resource availability, affinity/anti-affinity rules, taints/tolerations, etc.
      - Etcd - It is like database, A distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data, configurations, and state. It acts as the single source of truth.
      - Controller Manager -  Runs various controllers that handle routine tasks like:
          - Node controller (check node status)
          - Replication controller (ensure desired pod count)
          - Endpoint controller, etc. 
      - CLoud Controlller Manager - Kubernetes interact with the cloud provider's APIs. It separates out the cloud-specific logic from the rest of the Kubernetes core.
  - In Data plane, consistes of components like Kubelet, Kube proxy, Container runtime interface (CRI)
      - Kubelet - An agent on each node that ensures containers are running as per pod specs.
      - Kube proxy - Manages networking and load-balancing across pods and services on a node.
      - Container runtime interface - Pulls and runs containers inside pods.

2. Deployment vs stateful set
3. Stateful Vs Stateless
4. How do you manage data of stateless application?
5. If there is file which is being used by 2 customers, and need to deploy that file in k8s cluster and on prem as well, how to do that?
6. How to deploy an app to k8s cluster in terms of app deploy only ( basically explain CD part)
7. If secret is stored in vault inside a pod and that pod is down then how to tsg
8. Contents written inside deployment.yaml or heml chart
9. In Kubernetes, if a pod is in a pending state, how do you troubleshoot?
