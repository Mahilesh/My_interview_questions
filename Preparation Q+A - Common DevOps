- Check logs and monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana, CloudWatch).
- Identify the failing component (app, DB, network).
- Restart service or redeploy if needed.
- Notify stakeholders.
- Document root cause.
2. If any service is down for more than 2 weeks and customer is asking for update, what will you tell to customer?

- Set up monitoring/alerts.
- Implement auto-restart or self-healing.

5. In Airflow, if a job fails, how do you debug it?
- Check task logs and DAG UI.

- Re-run task after fix.
6. If you're facing performance issues on a server, how do you troubleshoot?
