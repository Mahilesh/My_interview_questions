with answers:-
=============
1. What is ELB and give a proper definition?
Ans:- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is an AWS-managed service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets (such as EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses) in one or more Availability Zones to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.
2. What are different types of LB in AWS?
Ans:- Classic, Application, Network, Gateway
3. What's different about ALB & NLB?
Ans:- ALB - Layer 7, http/https, path based routing, used for webapplications, microservices
NLB - Layer 4, tcp/udp, port based, used for video gaming, video streaming.
4. LB is which use case is used?
Ans:- Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances - Used for High Availabilty
5. Suppose the target is unhealthy, how Will you troubleshoot and how will you make it healthy?
Ans:- First we need to make sure ports are allowed in both instance level SG and load balancer level SG.
Check :- Protocol, port, path, success codes.
check whether app is running or not.
6. Types of Load balancing techniques?
Ans:- Round-robin, least connections, least response time, IP hash/source IP affinity, ...
7. How will the load balancer distribute the traffic?
Ans:- using listerners in target group
8. Scaling policies?
Ans:- 5 types - Target tracking scaling, step scaling, simple scaling, scheduled scaling, predictive scaling
9. Diff between launch template and launch configuration
Ans:- Launch Configurations are legacy and immutable, while Launch Templates support versioning, advanced EC2 features like Spot and mixed instances, and are the recommended way to define instance launch settings in Auto Scaling Groups.
10. Desired minimum and maximum?
Ans:- Desired capacity is not a limit; it’s the current target value. Min and Max define the boundaries within which Desired can change.
11. What are Lifecycle hooks?
Ans:- Lifecycle hooks allow us to pause EC2 instances during launch or termination in an Auto Scaling Group so we can run custom actions like configuration, traffic draining, or cleanup before the instance enters or exits service.”
Max time set - 48 hours (heartbeat timeout)
12. What is scale in and scale out. Suppose scaling is not triggered, how will you troubleshoot?
Ans:- Scale out - Add instances, Scale In - remove instances. Verify Scaling Policy Configuration
13. Diff between horizontal scaling and vertical scaling?
Ans:- HS - Increase or decrease the no. of instances to handle the traffic
VS - Increase resources like CPU, Memory, Storage of an existing instance
14. Launch template can be edited directly?
Ans:- You create a new version
