with answers:-
=============
1. What is ELB and give a proper definition?
Ans:- 
2. What are different types of LB in AWS?
Ans:- Classic, Application, Network, Gateway
3. What's different about ALB & NLB?
Ans:- ALB - Layer 7, http/https, path based routing, used for webapplications, microservices
NLB - Layer 4, tcp/udp, port based, used for video gaming, video streaming.
4. LB is which use case is used?
Ans:- Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances - Used for High Availabilty
5. Suppose the target is unhealthy, how Will you troubleshoot and how will you make it healthy?
Ans:- First we need to make sure ports are allowed in both instance level SG and load balancer level SG.
Check :- Protocol, port, path, success codes.
check whether app is running or not.
6. Types of Load balancing techniques?
Ans:- Round-robin, least connections, least response time, IP hash/source IP affinity, ...
7. How will the load balancer distribute the traffic?
Ans:- using listerners in target group
8. Scaling policies?
Ans:- 5 types - Target tracking scaling, step scaling, simple scaling, scheduled scaling, predictive scaling
9. Diff between launch template and launch configuration
Ans:- 
10. Desired minimum and maximum?
Ans:- 
11. What are Lifecycle hooks?
Ans:- 
12. What is scale in and scale out. Suppose scaling is not triggered, how will you troubleshoot?
Ans:- Scale out - Add instances, Scale In - remove instances
13. Diff between horizontal scaling and vertical scaling?
Ans:- HS - Increase or decrease the no. of instances to handle the traffic
VS - Increase resources like CPU, Memory, Storage of an existing instance
