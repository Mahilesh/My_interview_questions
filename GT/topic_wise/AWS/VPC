with answers
=============
1. how many VPC you can create in single region.
Ans:- Default 5 VPC, if needed we can increase by AWS support
2. how many IGW you can create in single region.
Ans:- 5 IGW
3. how many route table you can create inside a VPC
Ans:- 200 Route table per VPC
4. how many subnet you can create in single region.
Ans:- 200 subnet per VPC 
5. how many SG and NACL you can create in single region.
Ans:- 2500 SG and 200 NACL per VPC
6. how many inbound and outbound you can create in SG?
Ans:- Inbound - 60, Outbound - 60 per SG
7. How many inbound and outbound created in Nacl?
Ans:- Inbound - 20, Outbound - 20 per NACL
8. How many security group attached in EC2?
Ans:- 5 SG
9. One EC2 instance have one interface, how many security group can associate?
Ans:- Up to 5 Security Groups can be associated with a single network interface (ENI) by default.
10. How many network interface can be attached in Single instance?
Ans:- It depends on the EC2 instance type.
Each instance type has a maximum number of ENIs
Example:
t2.micro → 2 ENIs, m5.large → 3 ENIs, High-end instances → many more
👉 There is no single fixed number for all instances.
11. What are local routes and custom routes?
Ans:- Local route: auto-created, internal VPC traffic
Custom route: user-defined, external or specific traffic paths
12. What's vpc flow logs? 
Ans:- VPC Flow Logs capture IP traffic metadata going to and from network interfaces in a VPC. They are mainly used for network monitoring and troubleshooting connectivity issues.
13. It's possible to attach single RT to multiple subnets.
Ans:- Yes, a single route table can be associated with multiple subnets within the same VPC.
14. How many ips can reserve in 10.0.0.0 network and purpose of those reserved ips?
Ans:- 5 reserved. 1st - network address, 2nd - router, 3rd - DNS, 4th - future use, last IP - broadcast
15. What is the minimum and max CIDR block?
Ans:- CIDR block size for a VPC must be between /16 and /28.
16. What is End point?
Ans:- VPC Endpoint enables private communication between a VPC and AWS services without using the public internet.
17. VPC peering?
Ans:- Communication between two VPCs.
18. Transit gateway?
Ans:- It acts as a central hub, make communication between multiple VPC.
