============
1. How will you secure a s3 bucket
Ans:- To secure an S3 bucket, I keep it private with public access blocked, control access using bucket policies with ACLs disabled, use access points for fine-grained access, enable encryption at rest and in transit, protect data with versioning and object lock, replicate data for resilience, and enable server access logging for audit and monitoring.
2. Explore bucket versioning use cases and scenarios
Ans:- S3 bucket versioning is used to retain multiple versions of an object, which helps in recovering data from accidental deletions, overwrites, or application errors. When an object is deleted, S3 adds a delete marker instead of permanently removing the object, allowing us to restore previous versions easily.
3. Encryption (SSE,Dual size encryption)
Ans:- 
4. life cycle rules in s3
Ans:- S3 lifecycle rules are used to automatically manage objects during their lifetime by transitioning them between storage classes or expiring them, based on predefined conditions.
5. What are the storage class
Ans:- S3 storage classes define how data is stored, accessed, and priced, based on access frequency, latency needs, and durability requirements.
6. How will you host website in s3(static webhosting)
Ans:-
7. Event notification in S3
Ans:-
8. Object Lock
Ans:-
9. CRR and its configuration
Ans:-
10. CORS (theory alone)
Ans:- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security mechanism that controls how a web application running on one origin can request resources from another origin. It prevents unauthorized cross-origin access to resource
11. Life cycle scenarios
Ans:-
12. S3 is a global then why we have buckets region specific
Ans:- S3 is a global service in terms of namespace and API access, but buckets are region-specific because data must physically reside in a region for latency, compliance, cost optimization, and durability across AZs.
13. Multipart upload in S3
Ans:- Multipart upload allows large objects to be uploaded to S3 in multiple parts, improving performance and fault tolerance, and is mandatory for objects larger than 5 GB.
14. Check whether 50tb upload works in multipart upload or not
Ans:- No, S3 multipart upload cannot upload 50 TB as a single object because the maximum S3 object size is 5 TB. Multipart upload only improves upload performance, not the object size limit.
15. Storage types in s3
Ans:-
16. General purpose bucket vs directory bucket in s3
Ans:-
17. Mechanisms to secure s3 bucket
Ans:-
18. How to maintain high availability in S3
Ans:- S3 maintains high availability by automatically replicating data across multiple Availability Zones within a region. It is a fully managed service with built-in scaling and failover, offers 99.99% availability SLA, and supports features like versioning and cross-region replication to protect against logical errors and regional failures.
