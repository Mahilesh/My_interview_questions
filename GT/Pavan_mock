Not answered questions
----------------------
1. How many SG can be attached to one ec2 instance? 
Ans:- Only 5 SG is allowed to add.
2. give temp access to one object in S3? 
Ans:- yes possible by giving pre-signed URL -> Max 12 hrs
3. In Replication rules, Source to destination possible, Is destination to source possible? 
Ans:- by default, not possible. But by applying "replica modification sync" in both source and destination we can achieve this
4. what is DHCP option set? and its purpose. 
Ans:- Automatically assigns IPs, DNS, domain name, and NTP to instances.
5. Is it possible to add secondary IP to ec2 instance? Why and use case 
Ans:- Yes possible by Manage IP Address -> Assign new secondary IP address Ex:- 10.0.16.1/32
6. Max and min size of CIDR block - which AWS recommends
Min /16 to Max /28
7. Is it possible to set our required one IP address for subnet without dhcp option set? ex:- CIDR - 10.0.0.0/24 , my_db server I need - 10.0.1.100
Ans:- Reserve specific IP ranges using CIDR reservations 
8. Without SG can we able to create ec2 instance?
Ans:- NO
9. R - I need few more IPs for existing VPC, how it possible to increase it?
Ans:- adding a secondary CIDR block.
10. R - SNS - one case? 
Ans:- CPU high -> SNS -> DevOps team notified
11. R - My current date data is corrupted so I need to recover before 5 days data. But I do not do snapshots backup , only AMI is available
Ans:- Use snapshots inside AMI. 
AMI → snapshot → EBS → attach to existing instance

Questions
---------
1. Can you tell me AWS services which you extensively used in your project? -> EC2, ELB, RDS, 

2. Prod ec2 instance unreachable which is running fine for last 1 year-> Steps involved in troubleshooting
Ex:- 0/3 failed	Instance is down/unreachable
- 1. Running status -> Instance -> Actions -> System log - STATUS CHECK  
      -> 1. System check   → Stop/start instance (move to new host) or contact AWS support
      -> 2. Instance check → Reboot, check logs, recover instance
      -> 3. Network check  → Check security group, NACL, route table, ENI
- 2. Check cloudwatch logs -> log group -> Metrics -> System health, Compute resources like CPU, memory, disk
- 3. Check network layer -> SG, NACL, IP address
- 4. Check cloudtrail logs
To fix:- (steps)
- Go to ALB -> remove target
- Using AMI -> create new server -> register new instance into ALB
- Login into new server -> now troubleshoot

3. App is slow?? & 100 users -> 50 - ok, 50 - not ok - Steps to troubleshoot

Possible reason for failure 
  - Any DB query running in backend
  - Check CPU usage
To fix:-
- Give Cloudfront URL with latency based routing policy - to reduce the slowness/latency issue

3. ELB -> 4 EC2 Register -> healthy ?? Health Status Check : Parameter -> Protocol, port, path, timeout
(Time to start the instance) -> Probes concept 

4. VPC peering vs TG -> 10 VPC 
which is fast -> VPC peering
which is cheap -> VPC Peering is cheaper for small setups, while Transit Gateway cost increases with attachments and traffic.
which is better in config -> TG
best performance -> VPC peering

5. which use case - you select ALB and NLB
ALB -> which uses layer 7 (http/https), path/host/domain/ip based routing                                               -> In Web applications, Microservices
NLB -> which uses layer 4, port based routing, ultra low latency, Millions of requests per second, non-http traffic (tcp/udp)     -> In gaming, Video streaming


6. Diff bt TCP and UDP
TCP - sends the data in secure and in order - ports used - 80, 443, 8080, 22, RDP, 3306, ....so on - 3 way handshake
UDP - sends the data in fast, without checking if it arrived - ports used - 53, - pocket loss

7. 500, 501, 502, 503 -> Problem is on the server side (server failed to process a valid request)
500 - Internal Server Error -> Application crash / unhandled exception
502 - Bad Gateway           -> ALB/Nginx got invalid response from backend
503 - Service Unavailable   -> App down / scaling / maintenance
504 - Gateway Timeout       -> Backend took too long to respond
507 - Insufficient Storage  -> Disk full

8. 400, 401, 402, 403, 404 - Problem is on the client side (request is wrong)
400 - Bad Request   -> Invalid request syntax / missing parameters
401 - Unauthorized  -> Authentication required or token missing
403 - Forbidden     -> Authenticated but no permission
404 - Not Found     -> Resource/URL doesn’t exist

9. Cloudwatch - Metrics -??
CPU, Memory, Target, Disk usage, network in/out, status check, ebs volumes iops readwrite operation

10. Recent issues you faced in EC2

11. Recent issues you faced in our recent project?

=> Include your issues in your self-intro ***********

Recently faced issue in VPC
-> 100s of VPC -> move to TG -> refer blog -> use terraform -> terraform import -> take existing resources and did automation
