# AWS DevOps Revision Questions

## Set 1: Core EC2, VPC, S3, ELB

1. An application running on EC2 needs to upload files to S3.
   How would you provide access without using access keys on the server?
2. What is the difference between Security Groups and Network ACLs?
   Give one real scenario where a NACL is required instead of a Security Group.
3. You want to increase the size of an EBS volume attached to a running EC2 instance.
   What are the steps involved, including OS-level changes?
4. Explain any three S3 storage classes and when you would use each.
5. An EC2 instance in a public subnet still has no internet access.
   What are the top things you would check?
6. What happens if one target becomes unhealthy in a target group?
   How does ELB detect this?
7. How would you monitor disk usage of an EC2 instance using CloudWatch?
8. If someone deleted an EC2 instance, how would you find:
   * Who deleted it
   * From where
   * At what time
  Explain the steps.
9. Explain how SNS works.
   Give one real-time use case where SNS is better than email alerts.
10. An application needs a shared file system that multiple EC2 instances can read and write simultaneously.
    Which service would you choose and why?

## Set 2: IAM, Networking, Load Balancing, Serverless

11. You have an EC2 instance that suddenly becomes unreachable over SSH, but it is still showing running in the AWS console.
    How would you troubleshoot this step by step?
12. What is the difference between EBS and Instance Store?
    In which scenarios would you never use EBS?
13. An application team complains that someone accidentally deleted critical files from an S3 bucket.
    What AWS features would you use to prevent and recover from this?
14. What is the difference between:
    * IAM Role
    * IAM User
    * IAM Policy
      Why is using IAM Roles on EC2 considered a best practice?
15. Why do we need public and private subnets in a VPC?
    Can an EC2 instance in a private subnet access the internet? If yes, how?
16. Explain the difference between ALB and NLB.
    Give one real use case for each.
17. How does Route 53 route traffic to resources?
    Explain any two routing policies and where you would use them.
18. What is the core difference between CloudWatch and CloudTrail?
    Give one real incident where CloudTrail is more useful than CloudWatch.
19. What happens internally when a Lambda function is invoked?
    What are cold starts, and how can you reduce them?
20. You mounted an EFS file system on EC2, but the mount command hangs and never completes.
    What are the top three things you would check immediately?

## Set 3: Advanced AWS Concepts and Troubleshooting

21. An EC2 instance is running, but the application is not reachable on port 8080.
    List the layers you would check, in order.
22. What is the difference between:
    * AWS Managed Policy
    * Customer Managed Policy
    * Inline Policy
      Which one is recommended and why?
23. How do S3 bucket policies differ from IAM policies?
    Give one use case for each.
24. What is Source/Destination Check in AWS?
    When do we disable it?
25. What is a Target Group?
    Can one target group be attached to multiple load balancers?
26. What happens if two Route 53 records have the same name and type?
    Is it allowed? Explain.
27. What is the difference between:
    * CloudWatch Metrics
    * CloudWatch Logs
    * CloudWatch Alarms
28. Can a Lambda function access resources inside a private subnet?
    If yes, how?
29. What is the difference between:
    * EFS and EBS
    * EFS and S3
      Provide a short comparison.
30. What is the difference between SNS and SQS?
    When would you use both together?


Questions I answered wrongly

How can an application running on EC2 upload files to S3 without using access keys on the server?
You attached an IAM role to an EC2 instance, but AWS CLI commands are still failing with AccessDenied. What could be wrong?
What are the mandatory components required to make an EC2 instance publicly accessible from the internet?
Why does a public IP alone not guarantee internet access to an EC2 instance?
Why do we use a NAT Gateway instead of an Internet Gateway for private subnets?
An EC2 instance in a private subnet cannot reach the internet even though a NAT Gateway exists. What should you check?
A Lambda function works when tested manually, but fails when triggered by S3 events. Why?
CloudWatch alarms are not triggering even though the metric threshold is breached. What could be the reasons?
You enabled VPC Flow Logs, but you don’t see any traffic logs. Why?
EFS mount is hanging on an EC2 instance. What would you check?
CloudTrail is enabled, but you don’t see IAM-related events. Why could this happen?
